    <div class="bottom-right-text">Doc Hudson is one of the main characters in Cars. He is a dark blue 1951 Hudson Hornet. He was both the doctor and judge of Radiator Springs. He was the crew chief of Lightning McQueen.

      Doc was a well-respected vehicle in Radiator Springs. As the town's motor-medic, he'll sort out all the residents' health issues, and gives thorough checkups at his medical clinic. Very loyal to all his friends, Doc holds a lot of influence and has strong opinions on the sort of cars he wants in his town. Sometimes he can be a stubborn car of few words, but at other times he delivers very wise advice such as turn right to go left.</div>
